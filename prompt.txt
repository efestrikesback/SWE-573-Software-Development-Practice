We are going to build a community builder web app like reddit using
Java Springboot with maven build
PostgreSQL and Docker

I will share all the requirements and the architecture with you, then we will build the project together you will write every single line of code in full detail and you will never tell me to finish rest. 
when you share a code you will share the full class and its path in directory.


= SPEC-001: Community Builder App

== Background

The motivation behind creating the Community Builder App is to offer a platform that enables users to foster and engage with communities of various interests. This web-based application aims to provide an intuitive and customizable environment where communities can thrive through user interaction, content sharing, and effective moderation. By leveraging Java Spring Boot, the app will ensure scalability, security, and ease of maintenance, making it suitable for a wide range of community types, from professional networking groups to interest-based forums.

== Requirements

The Community Builder App will focus on the following key functionalities, prioritized as per their significance to the platform's success:

=== Must Have

* **Community Creation and Management**
** Ability to create communities with unique identifiers and descriptions.
** Archiving instead of deletion for communities.

* **User Account System**
** Simplified login with username and password.
** Profile customization with pictures and nicknames, supporting anonymity.

* **Content Creation and Interaction**
** Template-driven content creation.
** Editing feature with "edited" label indication.
** Upvoting and downvoting capabilities.

=== Should Have

* **Sorting and Filtering**
** Options for content sorting: recent, trending, hot.

* **Reporting and Moderation**
** Reporting functionalities for users and content.
** Defined roles and permissions for community moderation.

=== Could Have

* **User Interaction**
** User follow system with visibility on follower counts.

=== Won't Have (for now)

* Real-time chat or messaging system.
* Integration with external social media platforms for content sharing or login.


== Method

The Community Builder App will be developed using a microservices architecture, leveraging Java Spring Boot for building individual services. This architecture facilitates scalability, maintainability, and the seamless integration of new features. The app will be composed of several key services: User Management, Community Management, Content Management, and Reporting & Moderation. Each service will be containerized using Docker, providing consistency across development, testing, and production environments. Kubernetes could be considered in the future for orchestration as the application scales. PostgreSQL is chosen for its reliability and robust support for complex queries and relationships, which is ideal for our data management needs.

=== High-Level Architecture

The application will be divided into microservices as follows:

- **User Management Service**: Handles user registration, login, profile updates, and anonymity settings.
- **Community Management Service**: Manages community creation, archiving, member management, and content association.
- **Content Management Service**: Responsible for content creation, editing, templating, voting, and comments.
- **Reporting & Moderation Service**: Deals with report submissions, moderator assignments, and actions on reports.

Each service will communicate with others through well-defined APIs, using synchronous RESTful or asynchronous messaging patterns where appropriate.

=== Database Schema Design

The database schema will reflect the entities outlined in the provided UML, with relations adjusted for optimal performance in PostgreSQL. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

- **User**: Stores user credentials, profile information, and activity. Each user has a one-to-one relationship with a Profile and can have many-to-many relationships with Communities through membership.
- **Community**: Contains details about each community, including its members and associated content. It has a many-to-many relationship with Users and a one-to-many relationship with Content.
- **Content**: Includes user-generated content within communities. Each content item is linked to a User (author) and can have many Comments.
- **Report**: Captures reports made by users against content or other users, managed by moderators.

For the sake of brevity, specific table designs and relationships will be detailed in the full documentation.

=== Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot for microservices.
- **Containerization**: Docker for creating containerized instances of each microservice.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
- **Frontend**: (Assuming a web application) A modern JavaScript framework like React or Angular for the interactive UI, communicating with the backend through APIs.

== Implementation

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure the development environment, including Java JDK, Spring Boot setup, Docker containers, and PostgreSQL database installation.

2. **Microservices Development**:
   a. **User Management Service**: Implement user registration, login, and profile management functionalities.
   b. **Community Management Service**: Develop features for community creation, archiving, and member management.
   c. **Content Management Service**: Handle content creation, editing, voting, and commenting features.
   d. **Reporting & Moderation Service**: Create mechanisms for reporting content/users and moderation actions.

3. **API Development**: Design and implement RESTful APIs for microservices communication, ensuring security and scalability.

4. **Frontend Development**: Develop the user interface using a JavaScript framework, integrating with the backend through APIs.

5. **Testing**: Perform unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability and performance.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the application using Docker containers, initially in a staging environment for testing, followed by production deployment.
